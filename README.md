This repository contains samples of the HTML web pages that can be used as Custom Element Extensions in Kentico Kontent.

[Custom elements](https://developer.kenticocloud.com/docs/integrating-content-editing-features) help you with extending the basic functionality of Kentico Kontent UI and thus improving the content editing experience. Custom element is essentially a small HTML application that exists in a sandboxed `<iframe>` and interacts with the [Kentico Kontent](https://kenticocloud.com/) app via the [Custom Elements API](https://developer.kenticocloud.com/reference#custom-elements-api).

Note that Custom elements are only supported in the latest versions of our SDKs.

## Custom elements' samples overview

All of the samples are listed in the [Custom Element Gallery](https://kentico.github.io/custom-element-samples/gallery/index.html). The source code it stored in the [/gallery-src](/gallery-src) folder.

## How to create a custom element

You can find a detailed tutorial on how to create a Custom element in our [documentation](https://developer.kenticocloud.com/docs/integrating-content-editing-features).

### Custom element DevKit

To make development of custom elements as easy as possible, we created a [custom element devkit](https://github.com/Kentico/custom-element-devkit). The devkit includes Kentico Kontent alike wireframe and mocked API to enable seamless debugging experience. It is also capable of minimizing all assets and preparing custom element for production use.

### Styling your custom elements

By including Kentico Kontent default styles, you can make your Custom element look consistent with the rest of the UI.

The [/shared](https://github.com/Kentico/custom-element-samples/tree/master/shared) folder in this GitHub repository contains:

* [custom-element.css](https://github.com/Kentico/custom-element-samples/blob/master/shared/custom-element.css) – a CSS stylesheet
* [kentico-icons-v1.6.0.woff](https://github.com/Kentico/custom-element-samples/blob/master/shared/kentico-icons-v1.6.0.woff) – a font file
* [examples.html](https://github.com/Kentico/custom-element-samples/blob/master/shared/examples.html) – An HTML page containing the implementation details and an HTML markup of some of the basic elements. See also the link in Demo section.
  * showcase: [https://kentico.github.io/custom-element-samples/shared/examples.html](https://kentico.github.io/custom-element-samples/shared/examples.html)

We recommend you clone the files and host them locally yourself. The `kentico-icons-v1.6.0.woff` file needs to be hosted in the same directory as the CSS stylesheet to be properly linked.

## Feedback & Contributing

You can contribute by implementing a Custom Element Extension of your choice or pick one from the [ideas](https://github.com/Kentico/custom-element-samples/issues). Create an HTML web page, include the Custom Elements API in the code, describe what your element does in the Readme file, and send us a pull request.

### Pull request

The pull request should include:

* HTML web page with the custom element
* Additional files required for the custom element (js, css, ...) if needed
* [Styling code files](#styling-your-custom-elements) if needed
* `README.md` file containing
  * Description of the custom element functionality
  * Screenshot/gif showcasing the custom element
  * Step by step instructions how to add custom element to the Kentico Kontent UI
  * Configuration description example
  * Example of the output in the Delivery Response

If you want to list a custom element to the [Gallery](https://kentico.github.io/custom-element-samples/gallery/index.html), include a JSON file named by the custom element (preferably in Pascal Case) placed to [/gallery-src/content/elements](https://github.com/Kentico/custom-element-samples/tree/master/gallery-src/content/elements) folder in the following format:

```json
{
  "title": "NAME OF THE CUSTOM ELEMENT",
  "description": "CUSTOM ELEMENT DESCRIPTION",
  "thumbnailUrl": "URL FOT THE SHOWCASE (SCREENSHOT/GIF)",
  "readmeUrl": "URL FOR THE CUSTOM ELEMENT README"
}
```
